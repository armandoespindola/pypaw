### Introduction

This is the script used to generate the STATIONS_ADJOINT for adjoint simulation in specfem3d_Globe.

There are two things it needs:
  1. the measurements files generated by pyadjoint, including multiple period bands, which includes those stations with measurements for one event.
  2. the stations.json file which contains stations location information.

If you have multiple period bands, be sure to include all the measurement files inside the path json file.

#### Usage
1. Generate the path json file by running:
  ```
  python generate_path_adjoint_stations.py
  ```
  Be sure to modify the path information and eventlist in the script.

2. Run the converting using:
  ```
  pypaw-generate_adjoint_stations -f event1.path.json
  ```

### Introduction

This script is used to plot histogram of measurements generated by
pyadjoint, including traveltime(dt) and amplitude(dlnA).

It is very important to monitor the histogram, such as the upper
bound, lower bound, mean and standard deviation values of the
measurements distributions during the inversion.
